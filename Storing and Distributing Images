## Storing and Distributing Images

### Docker Hub
Docker Hub, which has both a freely available option, where you can only host publicly accessible images, and also a subscription option, which allows you to host your own private images. 

To do this, we first need to link our local Docker client to Docker Hub by running the following command:

`docker login`

You will then be prompted for your Docker ID and password.


`docker build --tag masteringdockerfouthedition/scratch-example:latest .`

`docker image push masteringdockerfouthedition/scratch-example:latest `
