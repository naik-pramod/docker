## Docker Intro
Docker is an open source engine that automates the deployment of applications into containers.
It follows the build once, run anywhere approach. Meanning we build a docker container and run it anywhere.(Windows/Linux/Mac/Laptop/CLoud/Data Center)

## Why Docker
 - Docker reduces the risk of 'worked in dev, now an ops problem'
 - Docker makes application portable, easy to build,distribute, scale.
 - Docker promotes distributed application architectcures - service-oriented and microservices.


## Uses of Docker
- Developer can build, run and share docker containers. Such as containers can be built in developement and promoted to testing environments and then to prod.
- Running standalone services and applications.
- To create isolated instances to run test like those run by jenkins.
- Building a multi-user Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS) infrastructure.
