### Docker Networking
Docker networking system is pluggable, using drivers.

There are several drivers available by default, and provides core networking functionality.

- bridge
 The default network driver. 
 Bridge networks are usually used when your applications run in standalone containers that need to communicate.
User-defined bridge networks are best when you need multiple containers to communicate on the same Docker host.

- host 
 For standalone containers, remove network isolation between the container and the Docker host, and use the hostâ€™s networking directly. 
Host networks are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated.

- overlay
Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services to communicate with each other. You can also use overlay networks to facilitate communication between a swarm service and a standalone container, or between two standalone containers on different Docker daemons. This strategy removes the need to do OS-level routing between these containers.
Overlay networks are best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, or when multiple applications work together using swarm services.

- macvlan
Macvlan networks allow you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network. The Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses.

Macvlan networks are best when you are migrating from a VM setup or need your containers to look like physical hosts on your network, each with a unique MAC address.

- none
For this container, disable all networking. Usually used in conjunction with a custom network driver
